# Salary Savings-2 - SDL2 Application
This project was made using my SDL Ready Functions Template. It's a graphic Windows Application which can divide a given salary by given divisions and deductions.

You can find the template with many SDL Ready functions that do Display, Audio, Input reading and more over here: [SDL Ready Functions Template](https://github.com/maxijonson/SDL2.0.4-Ready-Functions-Template)

Please note this project is really not the cleanest programming you'll ever see! It's very messy and could be optimized. The reason for this is because this is the project I've been using to build the SDL Functions Template project!
Nothing is better than actually making a project to test your functions! This project helped in finding bugs in the template as well as giving me ideas for new functions and making the template grow from V1.0 to V1.7!!!
The main objective here was basically to develop the SDL Template... and giving me a salary divider which I actually use every time I get paid!

Also note that this program was not intended to originally go public, but rather just to be used by me, so it is pretty much designed for my needs, but you can edit the .sav file to change the field names and change the Savings.h constants to shape it a bit more for you, but it probably isn't very 'open' in terms of features. Who knows, maybe i'll make a V3.0 where you'll have more leverage on what you can edit!

Other than that, this project is really just to showcase where the SDL Template as actually been developped.
